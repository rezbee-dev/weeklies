                    chelmico formed in 2014 after Rachel Watashiga and Mamiko Suzuki met through a mutual friend at a McDonald's in Arakawa, in Tokyo, Japan.
                    The two bonded over a love of music, particularly over Japanese hip-hop group Rip Slyme, and soon became regular friends.
                    At the time, Watashiga did some modeling work and appeared in the background of music videos for Ōmori Seiko.
                    When one of her friends offered her 10 minutes during a music event they were organizing in spring of 2014, Watashiga invited Suzuki to rap with her.

                    The next step came a year later, when they were given another offer to perform at another show for fifteen minutes. 
                    The two reached out to rapper PAGE, then known as Holly Page, to provide a track while they wrote lyrics. 
                    The end result was Labyrinth '97, their first single. 
                    Their first self-titled album was released in October 2016 under the Cupcake ATM label. 
                    In 2018, they released their album POWER under unBORDE, a division of Warner Music Japan, who they have been with since then.
