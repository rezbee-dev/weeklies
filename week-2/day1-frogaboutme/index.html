            <p class="lora">
                Glenn was born in <a href="https://chrono.fandom.com/wiki/Guardia">Guardia</a>, possibly in Truce or Dorino, in an unknown year prior to 590. His best friend was Cyrus, who was several years his senior. 
                Glenn was often a victim of indiscriminate bullying from the children his age due to his passive nature, which Cyrus often had to step in to stop. 
                When Cyrus suggested that he learn to fight back, Glenn explained that he doesn't wish harm on anyone, even if they hurt him. 
                Cyrus, seemingly resigned, called him a marshmallow.

                Several years later, when Glenn was a teenager, Cyrus declared his intent to enlist as a royal knight of Guardia. 
                He suggested that Glenn join him, but Glenn expressed doubts about his potential to be a good knight. 
                Cyrus pointed out that Glenn was better than him with a sword, but Glenn explained that he didn't think he could bring himself to hurt others. 
                Nonetheless, at some point, Glenn made the decision to take Cyrus' advice and enlisted as well.

                Following their talk, Glenn eventually came to Guardia to serve as Cyrus' aide. 
                During this time, he would journey with Cyrus on many adventures - including a battle with the <a href="https://chrono.fandom.com/wiki/Frog_King">Frog King</a> which yielded the retrieval of the Hero's Badge, a magic sigil that showed one's true strength and aided the wielder of the Masamune. 
                Glenn would also meet and befriend Queen Leene, who concerned herself greatly with his and Cyrus' safety.
